Luqmaan Ahmed Exercise 1

"Question. Discuss your
handling of passageExits, nonWallExits and the four controller methods. How did you
ensure your program is efficient?"

I realised early on that nonWallExits and then passageExits (and finally beenBefore) were repeatedly used in different
parts of the program. Therefore I created a surroundings object that computed all of these values whilst also remembering
what each exit was. This streamlined a lot of my now exploreControl code.
My abstraction resulted in the ExitType class which has organised my approach to the exits, and the exitsCreate which
removes repeated code.

I have made similar abstractions within exploreControl with the randomlySelect function. The function chooses from a set
of valid directions made available by the ExitType.isType array I created. So I can try to run in on passages, and then
run it on nonWalls.

"Question. Discuss your chosen implementation of the
RobotData class and how it is utilised by the backtracking. Discuss your reasoning for
how youâ€™ve designed your explorer and backTracker."

The RobotData class contains a Map from Point objects to Junctions. I realise that really, I could just store Headings
instead of the Coordinates again in the Junction, but this is really just a preference between doing additional
calculations to recreate a Junction everytime one is needed, or whether to just store the junctions.

The backtracking requests the Junctions heading using a Point, and then uses a modular arithmetic method to reverse the
heading. It then uses the convenient setHeading function to trace backwards. One thing I did was to reuse
exploreControl within backtrackControl selectively. I did this because the backtrackControl is a headingController and
exploreControl uses relative directions. explorerMode remained false which was the important distinction.

"Question.  Is there repeated code anywhere?
Could some functionality have been combined in a better way?"

I think my use of the surroundings object reduced repetition massively. The fact that I reused exploreControl is similar.
I think possibly robotData and surroundings could have been combined in a more interesting way, but they serve their
purpose adequately well.

"Question. Worst case analysis?"

In a non-loopy l*h solvable maze, this robot will always reduce the number of unexplored squares. An upper bound to the
number of steps would be l*h*n, where n is the number of junctions. P.S. This is not the lowest upper bound.
